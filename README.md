# Cody-Kietzman-Calendar-App
Challenge 5 calendar app

I was able to create the function of the calendar by creating variables that corresponded to the time.  I also created a variable to check the current hour and convert to military time.  This is how I check the current time with the time on the calendar and color code accordingly.  

I continue to struggle with local storage.  I understand the concept, but struggle with the syntax, espcially with adding jquery as that changes the syntax.  I worked on the local storage with a classmate to better understand.  Instead of creating variables for every text area, I chose to run a for loop to cycle through and target the parents and children elements using the specific hour ID tag.
